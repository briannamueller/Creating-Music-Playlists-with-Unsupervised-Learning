# Creating-Music-Playlists-with-Unsupervised-Learning

I have never been one to create music playlsits on Spotify. Most oftten, I don't want to take the time to create playlists On the rare occasions I do attempt to make a playlist, I don't know what's the best way to group my songs. Therefore, any song I like ends up in the 'Liked Songs' list with the rest of my 500+ saved songs. I wanted to see if I could use unsupervised learning as a solution. 

### Objective: Use the K-means clustering algorithm to separate my songs into playlists. The goal is create playlists that 'make sense' in terms of song similarity.

#### 1. Data cleaning / transformation
#### 2. EDA
#### 3. K-Means clustering

<br>You can find main steps of the K-Means clustering process below.<br>
